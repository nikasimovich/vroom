				<p>An entourage of roughly 30 ultra-stylized cars <img class="player" src="assets/imgs/play.svg">loudly rushed into the defunct Best Market Astoria&rsquo;s parking lot on a Friday night in early October.</p>

				<p>The events, which started happening weekly since the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, are intended for car enthusiasts to show off and Best Market, which closed in late August, has become a hotspot.</p>

				Some cars eject flames from the exhaust, others sport underbody lights that change hues through a phone app. Paint jobs of all colors abound: electric blue, cherry red, and a jet black Dodge Charger with neon purple lights.

				Not everyone is impressed, however. Since the onset of the pandemic, complaints about drag racing, related noise and hang outs on private property have skyrocketed in Queens. According to 311 data, 356 drag racing complaints were registered in September compared with only 79 in September 2019.</p>
				<p>
				Assemblywoman Nily Rozic has taken note and is introducing local legislation that would increase the hours of speed cameras can operate in streets with increased drag racing activity, according to a sponsored legislation summary on her website. Rozic did not return messages seeking comment.</p>

				Outside of Queens, Senator Andrew Gounardes of Brooklyn is proposing legislation that sets a decibel limit (95 for motorcycle mufflers and exhaust and 60 for car mufflers and exhaust) to quantify the noise, according to his legislative justification. His proposal would require police officers to carry a decibel reader, and increase the violation fine for offending vehicles.

			Despite these efforts, car meet-ups are thriving. To attend one, select participants receive direct messages of screenshots listing meeting locations, mostly parking lots. The most recent flyer warns:
			<p class="special indent">&ldquo;NO BULL SHIT AT PARK AND CHILL SPOTS! COME IN QUIETLY AND WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO THE NEXT SPOT!&rdquo;</p></p>
			
			According to the founder of Foreign Mob International, these instructions are meant to deter participants from racing between locations and to discourage the attention of police, which has increased due to the recent 311 complaints. The founder spoke on condition that his name be withheld because police are increasingly seeking to disrupt the meets.

			The clubs and affiliated <span class="special">&ldquo;fart cars,&rdquo;</span> as they&rquo;ve been dubbed by locals because of their noisy engines, are frequently discussed in the Astoria subReddit.
			</p>
			<p>
			Henry, 37, a case manager and participant on the Reddit channel, said he filed a recent 311 report on the cars, which were doing doughnuts and racing near Sunnyside Gardens at 2 in the morning.</p>
			&ldquo;Despite my windows being closed and the radio on, I could still hear the tires screeching for over an hour. Frankly, I need to sleep.&rdquo; he said.

				<p>At a car event titled &ldquo;Shake Da Block – The Hottest Weekly Car Meet in NYC,&rdquo; a white BMW pulled into a vacant parking spot at Metropolitan Plaza in Middle Village, the meet’s first location.</p>
				On the car’s side was a vinyl sticker of an Instagram handle: <img class="player" src="assets/imgs/img.svg">&ldquo;@selfmademichael.&rdquo; The car&rsquo;s windows were so opaque, it was difficult to see anyone inside. As the windows rolled down, a luscious cloud of berry-scented vape smoke dissipated, revealing two young faces behind it: Michael Adam, who is 20 and works as a census taker, and his friend, Elias Obando, also 20.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="full-text">
			<p>Adam said he spent $3,000 modifying his car&rsquo;s performance, exterior, and interior. His customizations include black tinted windows, gloss black grills, carbon fiber mirror caps and spoiler, larger exhaust tips, and sequential side markers.</p>
			<p>
			&ldquo;I want to add a custom steering wheel and a starlight roof for the interior.&rdquo; Adam said.
			He and Obando described the meet-ups&rsquo; goal as a &ldquo;place to study aesthetics and performance&rdquo; and to nerd out about everyone&rsquo;s customizations, which reveal a lot about the owner&rsquo;s taste.</p>

			<p class="special indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a culture,&rdquo; Obando said.</p>
			
			<p>Both agreed that some people take it too far by racing in the streets.</p>
			&ldquo;But this is only a few people out of a lot. The majority of the people are showing their car off and hanging out,&rdquo; Adam said.

			At Shake Da Block, police were waiting for attendees before the event even began. They circled the parking lot and <img class="player" src="assets/imgs/play.svg">directed participants off the premises.</p>
			<p>
			When asked why, they said there had been 911 calls about car meet-ups on private property. Some residents had concerns about racing and potential accidents.</p>

			The founder of Foreign Mob International skipped &ldquo;Shake Da Block&rdquo; because of the heightened police activity and instead prefers smaller gatherings.

			Foreign Mob has over 100 members in New York as well as a second chapter in New Jersey, has enforced COVID-19 safety protocols since hosting its the first meet.</p>
			<p>
			&ldquo;I literally said, if you don&rsquo;t have a mask, you can&rsquo;t enter,&rdquo;  the founder said about the trailblazing event. “I stood there at the entrance of someone else’s parking lot. When the cars would come in, I&rsquo;d make sure they had a mask and I would let them in, one by one.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>
			While he describes the main purpose of a car event as entertainment, his own group specializes in non-American cars, and the founder fashions his organization like a talent agency.</p>

			&ldquo;Whenever someone is looking for cars in their music video, they just click through my page and see lots of flavors: whether it&rsquo;s a Bentley, a Porsche, a Lambo, or a Benz,&rdquo; he said.
			The founder also sells branded hoodies, stickers, and license plate frames.

				The founder says the increase in police activity is apparent both at the events and police are attempting to &ldquo;catfish&rdquo; car groups on Instagram.</p>
				<p>
				&ldquo;They constantly message me the night of the event on six, seven, eight accounts,&rdquo; he said of the phony profiles.</p>
				<p>
				&ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re fake because they have two followers, only follow cars, and their bio says: <p class="special">&lsquo;I love car meets.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

				When asked if he&rsquo;s bothered by the negative police attention, the founder said, &ldquo;We honestly don’t care about the cops. It doesn’t matter what their opinion is. We care about what other people, like public citizens, say.&rdquo;

			<p>Not all locals have issues with the group. Anthony Roman, who is 37 and works at SingleCut Beersmiths, a brewery across the street from Best Market, sees the car hang outs every weekend during his shift.</p>

			&ldquo;They don&rdquo;t cause any trouble,&rdquo; he says, noting that sometimes they ask to use the restroom.

			However, the Foreign Mob is actively trying to improve the club&rsquo;s reputation by organizing charity events, such as an upcoming breast cancer awareness cruise.</p>

			<p>Participants will drive between two locations wearing pink shirts, with their cars wrapped in pink vinyl and embellished with breast cancer awareness decals. They&rsquo;ll also take donations.</p>

			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to make us really obvious to the cops,&rdquo; says the founder, &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re planning to do it anyway.&rdquo;
